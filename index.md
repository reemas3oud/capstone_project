## Social Development Bank (Q1 of 2019)

The Social Development Bank was established in 1971. The bank’s objectives are focusing on social loans; over the years the services expanded to include business loans as well. One of the most important pillars of the Social Development Bank is to empower the citizens in the field of offering loans in a way that enables them to play an effective role in the community. The Social Development Bank dataset was taken from Saudi Open Data Portal. Here is the link:

## Business Problem

Machine Learning in Data Science uses inputs from our daily lives and puts them in a process (or model), and then applies operations that the process has specified, and finally transforms them to outputs.

What is the funding value for a particular customer?
In our model we are predicting the funding value for a particular customer, based on the data provided in the Social Development Bank dataset.

After considering and exploring the customer information that has been provided to the Bank. We made a Linear Regression model that predicts the appropriate funding value that the customer is willing to get.OurLinear Regression model could help speed up the process for the Bank and shorten the time taken to finish it.
